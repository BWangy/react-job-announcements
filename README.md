# Job Announcements
This is a prototype for the NJ Civil Service Commission job announcements website written using React and ASP.NET Core Web API. This prototype relies on a database stored on the CSC servers that I unfortunately don't have access to anymore. However, I put the frontend and API code into this repository to demonstrate my implementation of those parts of my prototype. I have also replicated the database that I created on the CSC servers and published it along with my frontend and API to Azure so you can view the website with example data. The website may be a little slow when you first access it as the API is unloaded by Azure after a period of no incoming requests.
